# Python for Data Engineers
Repo containing notes, exercises, challenges, and final project from the [Python for Data Engineers Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-foundation-course/)

Got hands-on practice with Python 3 fundamentals, from basic data types to advanced data structures, and learned how to write clean, modular code using functions, objects, and packages. Completed coding exercises, challenges, and ultimately built a micro-project that consolidated everything I learned. 

## Topics Covered
- Programming fundamentals
- Types and data structures
- Control structures and loops
- Functions and lambda expressions
- Exception handling
- Object-oriented programming (objects and classes)
- Packages and modules
